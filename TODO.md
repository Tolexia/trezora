# TO DO

## Explore & Shop
* Init a drop rate = 0 when game starts, then increase it at each move, representing a probability to loot some stuff to sell in the shop. Reinit at 0 after looting
* Put monsters on map that could drop rare items 
* Shop : Make it functional -> Remains selling items


## Game design
* Difficulty system : increasing it at the same time as player levels up, but let the player modify it as they will. More difficulty is, stronger is the opponent and more coins gained

# DONE

## Explore & Shop
* Shop : Make it beautiful
* Powers could be disposable and available in shop when some level is reached, in order to make them more attractive and powerful. Price should be pretty low to be able to buy 1 or 2 by game
- Remains setting power items in the shop + handling power use counts + handling powers display if unlocked or not

## Fight
* Animate fights : smoke and kickback on attacker and after delay explosion on defender + screen shaking (smoke and explosion effect : increase scale and opacity)
* Ability to attack "AI"

## Game design
* Implementing levels depending on total xp
