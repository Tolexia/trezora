# TO DO
* Init a drop rate = 0 when game starts, then increase it at each move, representing a probability to loot some stuff to sell in the shop. Reinit at 0 after looting
* Implementing levels depending on total xp
* Difficulty system : increasing it at the same time as player levels up, but let the player modify it as they will. More difficulty is, stronger is the opponent and more coins gained
* Shop : Make it functional -> Remains selling items
* Animate fights
* Ability to attack "AI"

# DONE

* Shop : Make it beautiful
