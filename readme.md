# Find the treasure !

Greetings, fellow sailor !

Do you hear the call of adventure ?
Do you feel yourself the soul of a true pirate ?

If so, I heard that a treasure waits since a long time to be found...

But it won't be easy to find, the sea is big, and so are the perils.

Go ahead and make your attempt, sail across the sea and find the treasure before your opponent !

## How it works
1. When the game start, an hint helps you to determine on which type of tile the treasure is hidden.
2. Move the boat by clicking on the cardinal direction letters
3. At each move, your opponent does the same. It also knows on which type of tile the treasure is hidden and wants it as much as you.
4. The soul of ancient pirates (and the developper) helped you by giving special powers to find the treasure before your opponent. For now, you got inlimited powers.. Maybe in future updates these won't stay as easy to use.. ;)
5. If you find the treasure, you win the game and gain Xp. In the future, this xp will be the very ressources that will unlock your powers. For now, it's not so useful.
6. If your opponent find the treasure, you lose the game but also gain xp.
7. When the game is over, another starts immediately to keep on having fun.
8. For fellow developpers, a glimpse in your navigator console may reveal some interesting information.. ;)

## How it is build
- Plain Javascript
- Html 5
- CSS 3

## How it looks like

## Warning

The organisation of the code is not OPTIMIZED. 
The purpose of this game is not to be developped further, just to train javascript and css in a funny way.
However, I'm fully open to any suggestion or improvement idea.

Hope you will enjoy it :)
